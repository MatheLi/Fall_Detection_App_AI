# Mario Schweikert
Hey! My name is Mario and I am 16 years old. I am in year 11 at a German academic high
school. When I was 6 years old, I got my first computer. 6 years later I started
programming and took part in some competitions. Currently my favorite programming language
is Python but I also program in Java. After accomplishing my A-levels, I want to
study computer science. The competition „Bundeswettbewerb Künstliche Intelligenz“
aroused my interest in AI.

For a change I also do sports, e.g. tennis or cycling. In addition, I dance Standard/Latin at
a dancing school.

The project didn’t just arouse my interest in artificial intelligence, it improved my skills in different areas of expertise as well. For instance, I learned more about Python, particularly Keras and Numpy. I had to deal with different programming languages like Java or Python and new software. Moreover, it was fascinating to work together in a team with somebody I’ve never seen before in my life. At times it was hard for me to solve some of the problems which came up, but with a lot of endurance, we could realise such an impressive project. I’m glad I had the opportunity to participate in the competition “Bundeswettbewerb Künstliche Intelligenz”. I hope that I create another fascinating project in the future
